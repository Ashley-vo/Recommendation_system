# Recommendation_system
Recommendation system is simply explained as an engine to suggest the users customized products or services basing one thier behaviors in company's e-platform. Nowadays, recommendation system is widely applied in many business such as e-contents, websevices, e-commerce or online ads. Some familiar example would be Netflix or "items you may likes" on shopping websites. 

There three methods of recommendation: Content based, Collaborative filtering and Hybrid. 
In this part, I will make a simple collaborative filter algorithm to suggest suitable products for customers.

### Data source
For this case study, I will use the one of the publicly available datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail# 

Data set contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.



## Method
Collaborative filtering
- User_based approach: Based on individual purchase history. This appraoch has disadvantage for new customers who doesn have enough data to compare 
- Item_based approach: Based on the similarities between items. This algorimth can recommend product easy for both new and existing customers
